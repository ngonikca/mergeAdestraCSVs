This script joins the csv files downloaded from Adestra to make this process a little bit more automated.

The CSVs have to be saved to the 'files' directory, each file has to have it's filename as the date downloaded from adestra in format 'YYYY-MM-DD'.

The script will spit out a 'merged.csv' file ready to copy to the Email Acquisition sheet.
